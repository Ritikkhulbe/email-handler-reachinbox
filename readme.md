Due to some reason openai did not accept my only credit card and i couldn't arrange for any other: so i still 
added the code to ask for promts but then hard coded the mails, I would love to work in ReachInbox ai, 
because first of all I love the product and I know a lot of people are going to be using it in the coming 
future, and secondly I like to work on things from scratch and an opportunity to work in a 
startup is hard to come by.
